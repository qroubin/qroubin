### Welcome to my profile, here are some links to projects I contributed to :

In this project, I was a member of a team of 3 and we worked with both Java FX and Java AWT to develop a software for creating and managing geometrical figures in an editor window, with different tools to interact with them. Our main goal was to use the most Design Patterns and to follow Java's best practices.
We used a Model-View-Controller pattern and several design patterns like Method Factory, Singleton, Memento, and Command for the different actions possible within the editor.

### This is another account of mine I used during my bachelor's degree
https://github.com/quentin-roubin :

This is one of my most important projects in terms of duration. We worked in a team of 4 on a free subject, and we chose to make a game in Unity to strengthen our skills in C#. This game is a 2D RogueLike where the player has to escape from a tower by fighting ennemies in each room before continuing to the next one. As in any RogueLike, the player gets to choose between upgrades and builds up its character through the game. This project taught me several skills, like managing ennemies AI, setting up pathfinding, managing player stats and in general allowed me to get better at Object Oriented Programming.
